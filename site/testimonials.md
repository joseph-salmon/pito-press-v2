We acknowledge our role as tāngata Tiriti, we are manuhiri with no birthright to the Māori language. Therefore we are guided and informed by hoa haere and tāngata whenua experts.

Pito Press has developed since 2017, with valued input from a roopū of educators, advisors and consultants. Initial kōrero about our social enterprise with whanaunga/extended family (Graham Cameron - Ngāti Ranginui, Waitaha ā Hei, Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Hinerangi), was expanded through business study under Lou Brider (Ngāti Ruru, Ngāti Uenuku, Ngāti Rangi and Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi) at Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. Nicola Patrick of Thrive Whanganui and Paul Fletcher from The Generator mentored us throughout this development phase. Haydon Richards (Kāi Tahu) from HTK Group and Simon Putan from Whanganui & Partners have also provided direction.

We have appreciated discussion of our whakaaro with the late Matua Greg Ratana, Whaea Jas Ratana, the late Whaea Gail Imhoff, Whaea Sandy Nepia, Jay Rerekura, Matariki Cribb-Fox, Jess Firmin, Lisa Reweti and Meretini Bennett-Huxtable who all whakapapa to Whanganui.
