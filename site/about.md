He tāngata Tiriti māua. We are both Pākehā, our ancestors are from England, Ireland, Scotland, Spain and Germany. Joe (he/him/ia) grew up in Napier, and Kay (she/her/ia) in Whanganui. We acknowledge the tāngata whenua of these rohe. Ngā mihi ki Ngāti Kahungungu ki Heretaungā, ki Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi, ki Ngā Rauru hoki.

Kay began learning te reo Māori over 20 years ago and then returned to immersion study to support the language goals of her wider whānau. Kay & Joe met in Whanganui in 2009, later married and became parents.

When the eldest of our two tamariki was born in 2015, we chose to kōrero Māori at home. Pito Press grew out of our experiences speaking te reo Māori as a Pākehā family. While we are not yet fluent, we are both committed to our ongoing learning, ā, kei te ako tonu māua. Pito Press contracts Te Taura Whiri registered translators for Māori language publications.

We are grateful for the support of The Generator, Thrive Whanganui and our roopū of kaitautoko who have guided us as we’ve established Pito Press. Kei runga noa atu koutou!

\* pito (‘pi’ as in ‘peapod’ and ‘to’ as in ‘tornado’) translates from te reo Māori to ‘belly button’. A pito is a permanent reminder of our whakapapa. We are connected to those who have come before us, and those who are yet to come.
