As Pākehā, their families whakapapa to Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Germany and England. Joe (he/him) grew up in Napier, and Kay (she/her) in Whanganui and they acknowledge the mana whenua of these rohe. Ngā mihi ki Ngāti Kahungunu ki Heretaungā, ki Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi, ki Ngā Rauru hoki.

Kay began learning te reo Māori over 25 years ago and then returned to immersion study to support the language reclamation goals of her wider whānau. Joe established his graphic design practice in 2009 and met Kay at their mates’ cafe the same year. Married in 2013, they make a great team with a complementary combination of skills and interests. Both are adult second language learners and have spoken te reo Māori to their two young tamariki since birth.

Pito Press grew out of Joe & Kay’s experiences speaking te reo Māori as a Pākehā family and connecting with other second language learners. While they are not yet fluent, they are both committed to their ongoing learning. Pito Press contracts Te Taura Whiri registered translators for Māori language publications.

Over the last 5 years, the ideas Joe and Kay had about Pito Press have developed through discussions with a roopū of educators, advisors and consultants.

They are very grateful for the guidance, feedback and mentoring of:

* Graham Bidois Cameron - Ngāti Ranginui, Waitaha ā Hei, Ngāti Rangiwewehi, Ngāti Hinerangi
* Lou Brider - Ngāti Ruru, Ngāti Uenuku, Ngāti Rangi and Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi
* Nicola Patrick of Thrive Whanganui
* Paul Fletcher from The Generator
* Matariki Cribb-Fox - Ngā Rauru Kītahi, Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Kuia, Ngāti Mutunga, Ngāti Pikiao, Taranaki, Te Ātiawa (Taranaki), Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi
* Haydon Richards - Kāi Tahu from HTK Group
* Simon Putan from Whanganui & Partners

Pito Press acknowledges the support they’ve received in grants from The Generator and Whanganui & Partners. Ngā mihi.

_* pito (‘pi’ as in ‘peapod’ and ‘to’ as in ‘tornado’) translates from te reo Māori to ‘belly button’.   
A pito is a permanent reminder of our whakapapa.   
We are connected to those who have come before us, and those who are yet to come._
