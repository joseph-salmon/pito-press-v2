We can create a beautiful bilingual book about your beloved mokopuna for your whānau to treasure.

Customise a bilingual book to tell the story of the special relationship with your mokopuna, grandchild, irāmutu or pēpi. These personalised publications are perfect for learners of te reo Māori and young tamariki to share with their whānau.

* simple sentence structures, a great way to build confidence in spoken te reo Māori and support your family member in their learning
* tamariki love seeing photos of themselves and their beloved Aunty, Nan, Koro or Grandma
* high-quality design, typesetting, printing and binding that will last
* our Te Taura Whiri registered translators ensure quality te reo Māori.
* awesome idea for a special koha, especially for whānau that live far away. You receive 2 printed and bound copies, one to keep and one to gift.
* digital versions are available to purchase for download as PDFs, share in your favourite e-reader app

You submit a selection of photos, showing the special relationship and fun times shared between the child and family member. And choose from the various sentences to personalise, these will accompany the photos. The story will be typeset and laid out and we will send you a draft proof to check over. This is then written into simple te reo Māori sentences and sent to print.

Once you've added this to your cart and completed your purchase, you will receive a link to an online form. There you will upload your photos, captions and contact details. We will then be touch to discuss your Custom Mokopuna Story Book.
