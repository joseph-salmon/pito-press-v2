Our inaugural product is a perpetual dual calendar to support te reo Māori language learners wanting to understand maramataka.

This has been developed in collaboration with Meretini Bennett-Huxtable and te reo Māori translated by Matariki Cribb-Fox. Prototypes have been tested by our iwi partners; Jay Rerekura, Jasmin Ratana, Jo & Graham Cameron and whānau, and Lisa Reweti.

Learning from Dr Rangi Matamua’s kōrero and guided by Meretini Bennett-Huxtable, we have made a calendar that whānau from around the motu can customise with lunar phase kupu from their own rohe.

We have aligned the Gregorian solar calendar with the Māori lunar phases and included transliterated kupu for the Pākehā calendar months. This rauemi supports learners who are reclaiming an indigenous relationship to time through maramataka.

This tangible tool is appropriate for te reo Māori speakers of all ages and fluency levels. It sits in a recycled rimu stand and can be used year after year.

We have sourced our materials locally, engaged Whanganui craftspeople and experts with whakapapa Māori to make the final product and supported Māori-owned businesses wherever possible.
