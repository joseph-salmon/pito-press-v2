# Nau mai – welcome

We are Kay Benseman and Joe Salmon, co-founders of Pito Press, a social enterprise creating tools for learning and unlearning in Aotearoa.

Pito Press offers research, writing and design services. We also co-create resources and publications to tautoko those who are learning or reclaiming te reo Māori. We work in partnership with tāngata whenua to contribute to decolonisation in Aotearoa.

Pito Press is dedicated to making tools and resources for those learning or reclaiming te reo Māori by offering bespoke design, research and writing services.
