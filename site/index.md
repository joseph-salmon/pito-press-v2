## Nau mai / welcome

Pito Press is a social enterprise creating tools for learning and unlearning in Aotearoa. 

We research, write, design and co-create resources and publications to tautoko those who are learning or reclaiming te reo M훮ori. 

We work collaboratively as Te Tiriti partners with t훮ngata whenua to contribute to decolonisation.
